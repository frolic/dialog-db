//! Sealed lines: branches whose trees the archive holds only as layered
//! envelopes.
//!
//! A branch opened with a [`TreeSpace`] seals what each commit persists
//! (`dialog_keyring::layered`): every node becomes an envelope stored under
//! the hash of its own bytes, and every value a node spills becomes a
//! sealed value beside it. The archive, the remotes a push reaches, and
//! everything that copies blocks between them see only those. Reads open
//! them again through the same space.
//!
//! Above the archive nothing changes. A revision still names its tree by
//! the plaintext root, which is what the node cache, the live spine, diffs
//! and every reader key by; a sealed line's revision also carries where
//! that root's envelope lives ([`SealedTree`]), and the space learns where
//! each node below it lives as each parent opens. So a party reaches
//! exactly what descends from the heads it reads.
//!
//! # What stays in the clear
//!
//! - The head. Its branch, issuer, edition and causal context, as on any
//!   line; its plaintext root, which lets whoever reads the head confirm
//!   an exact guess of the root node and nothing more; and its sealed
//!   root, whose structure key lets whoever reads the head walk the tree's
//!   shape (how many nodes, how they link, how large each envelope is)
//!   and copy it, which is what a remote has to do.
//! - Assets marked [`plaintext`](dialog_artifacts::Asset::plaintext), and
//!   only those. Every other asset is sealed in pieces
//!   ([`layered::asset`](dialog_keyring::layered::asset)) and
//!   stored as its sealed copy, under the hash of the copy's bytes; the
//!   fact recording where that copy lives sits in the sealed tree. What a
//!   copy's length says of the asset's length is the one thing it gives
//!   away.
//! - Sync records, which stay on the replica that keeps them.
