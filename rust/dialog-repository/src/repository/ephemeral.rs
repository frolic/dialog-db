//! The ephemeral line: a memory-backed store with a head and an
//! instant log, no history, gone with the process.
//!
//! Every branch and snapshot carries one ([`Branch::overlay`],
//! [`Snapshot::overlay`](crate::Snapshot::overlay)): the home of
//! session facts folded into every read of the line but never
//! committed to its tree. It is built to sit under a reactive UI:
//!
//! - **Reads are range scans in the tree's own order.** Facts are held
//!   under the same three index keys the tree uses (entity, attribute,
//!   and value orders), so a selector's [`selector_range`] applies
//!   unchanged and the rows come out in exactly the order a tree scan
//!   would produce them, which is what lets the query layer's k-way
//!   merge interleave this store with branch scans.
//! - **Writes are set operations with the tree's semantics.** An
//!   assert is idempotent, a replace supersedes the other values at
//!   its `(entity, attribute)` cell, a retract removes the exact
//!   triple. A retract of a fact the store does not hold is a
//!   *tombstone* that hides the same fact in the lines beneath, which
//!   is how a session shadows a committed fact without touching the
//!   tree.
//! - **Every change is an instant.** A write that changes what readers
//!   see mints one [`Instant`]: the facts that became readable, the
//!   facts that stopped being readable, a sequence number, and a
//!   chained hash. Instants are kept in a bounded ring so a
//!   subscription pinned at an earlier sequence reads the exact delta
//!   since its pin ([`Ephemeral::since`]) and maintains its result per
//!   touched entity instead of recomputing. Nothing is hashed but the
//!   delta, so a commit costs the delta, never the store.
//!
//! A [`Revision`](EphemeralRevision) here is an identity, not a
//! persistence claim: the sequence plus the chained hash of every
//! instant so far. Two stores reaching the same state by different
//! paths carry different hashes, which is the trade for never hashing
//! the fold.
//!
//! [`selector_range`]: dialog_artifacts::tree::selector_range
//! [`Branch::overlay`]: crate::Branch::overlay
