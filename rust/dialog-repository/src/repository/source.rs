//! What a read or a commit needs from the line it works on, whether
//! that line is a [`Branch`] or a [`Snapshot`].
//!
//! The two differ in one thing only: where the head lives. A branch keeps
//! it in a memory cell that advances under CAS and that every handle to
//! the branch shares; a snapshot keeps its own, which moves only through
//! commits on that very handle. Everything a query or a commit does
//! downstream of "which root, which store, which caches" is identical,
//! so it is written once against [`SourceRef`] and both kinds plug in.
