//! UCAN delegations as data in the branch tree.
//!
//! A retained delegation decomposes into two synced pieces:
//!
//! - **Slim facts** under the reserved `dialog.ucan/*` attributes, one per
//!   queried field (audience, subject, issuer, command, and the validity
//!   bounds when present), on the entity `asset:<hash>` of the certificate's
//!   encoded envelope. They are ordinary version-controlled facts: they ride
//!   the fact indexes, replicate with the tree, merge with observed-remove
//!   semantics, and answer datalog queries.
//! - **The signed envelope as an asset**, addressed by that same hash and
//!   recorded by its `dialog.asset/size` fact so push ships the bytes and a
//!   replica hydrates them on demand. The envelope is never decomposed: policy,
//!   meta, nonce, and signature live only there, and proof assembly reads
//!   it back byte-identical.
//!
//! Both land in ONE commit, so the denormalized fields cannot drift from the
//! envelope. Retraction mirrors it: the facts and the asset are retracted in
//! one commit; the bytes stay in the blob store (reclaiming unreferenced
//! bytes is the deferred GC concern). A certificate retained before assets
//! recorded its envelope in the blob index instead, and its retraction
//! tombstones that entry.
//!
//! The surface is a [`Delegations`] handle on the branch:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use dialog_capability::{Fork, Provider};
//! # use dialog_effects::archive::{Get, Import, Put};
//! # use dialog_effects::authority::{Attest, Identify};
