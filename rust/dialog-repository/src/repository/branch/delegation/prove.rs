//! Chain search over retained delegations.
//!
//! The tree-backed counterpart of the certificate store's
//! [`prove`](dialog_capability::access::CertificateStore::prove), searching
//! the `dialog.ucan/*` facts instead of listing and decoding stored
//! certificate files. The walk considers **slim candidates** read from the
//! facts (issuer, subject, command, validity bounds) and only fetches and
//! decodes an envelope at admission time:
//!
//! - a **direct** candidate (issuer = subject) is admitted the moment it is
//!   seen, so the common case reads one envelope no matter how many
//!   delegations are retained;
//! - an **indirect** candidate is deferred until every direct candidate of
//!   the hop has been tried, preserving the direct-first preference of the
//!   certificate-store walk;
//! - a candidate whose subject, command cover, or validity window already
//!   fails on the facts is skipped without touching its envelope.
//!
//! Each queue entry carries the principals already on its path, so a cyclic
//! delegation graph cannot loop the walk; `MAX_DEPTH` still bounds honest
//! depth exactly like the certificate-store walk.
