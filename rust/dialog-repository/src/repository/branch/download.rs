//! Materialize a branch's content locally.
//!
//! A pull adopts an upstream head by reference: subtrees the local
//! replica never changed stay remote and hydrate lazily as reads touch
//! them, and blob bytes replicate on first read. That laziness is the
//! right default for sync cost, but sometimes the caller wants the
//! opposite guarantee — everything the head references present locally,
//! before going offline or before latency-sensitive reads (the
//! authorization walk over an access branch is the motivating case).
//!
//! [`Branch::download`] provides it: one walk of the current revision
//! through the snapshot export machinery with download reach, fetching
//! every block and blob the revision references that the local store
//! does not hold, caching each as it lands. [`Pull::download`] chains
//! the two acts — adopt the upstream head, then materialize it.
