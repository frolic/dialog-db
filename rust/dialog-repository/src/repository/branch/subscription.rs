//! Standing query subscriptions, incrementally gated by demand.
//!
//! A [`Subscription`] registers a query once and is then *polled*:
//! each poll compares the branch's current revision against the
//! revision the subscription last evaluated at. Re-evaluation is
//! gated by the subscription's **demand cover** — the set of index
//! key ranges the previous evaluation read, recorded at the `Select`
//! boundary — intersected with the tree diff between the pinned root
//! and the new one:
//!
//! - no root change → nothing to do;
//! - root changed but no diff entry falls inside the cover → the
//!   result cannot have changed; the pin advances without
//!   re-evaluating (this is the point: unrelated writes are free);
//! - a diff entry falls inside a *fact* range → maintain
//!   incrementally when the query supports it (see below), emit the
//!   result [`Delta`], advance the pin;
//! - a diff entry falls inside a *rule-discovery* range → the rule
//!   set may have changed, which can affect any row: full
//!   re-evaluation, cover re-recorded.
//!
//! The cover is the *demanded* range, not the touched data: a scan
//! that came back empty still recorded its range, so absence reads
//! (a fact that wasn't there yet, a rule that wasn't installed yet)
//! are invalidated by later writes into the demanded range.
//!
//! # Incremental maintenance (DRed / FBF)
//!
//! For fact changes, the delta is derived without re-evaluating the
//! whole query: the changed datums name their subject entities, and
//! for each touched entity the retained rows are over-deleted and
//! re-derived by evaluating the query *restricted to that entity*
//! ([`Application::restrict`]) — DRed's delete / re-derive / insert,
//! with the goal-directed re-evaluation playing both the re-derive
//! and insert steps. A row with surviving alternate derivations is
//! simply re-derived, which handles the multi-derivation retraction
//! case (FBF's concern) exactly, without counting.
//!
//! For attribute queries the affected entities are the changed
//! facts' subjects. For concept queries they are discovered against
//! the resolved rule set
//! ([`affected_entities`]): entity-local rules
//! ([`AnalyzedRule::is_entity_local`]) contribute the changed
//! subjects, and non-local rules — concept premises reading *other*
//! entities' facts (a conformance check, a variant's negation) —
//! contribute delta-join heads: the changed fact bound into the
//! premise it matches, the remaining premises joined sideways, the
//! head variable projected. Recursion and shapes the discovery does
//! not handle fall back to a full recompute, which is always sound.
//! [`recomputes`](Subscription::recomputes) and
//! [`maintenances`](Subscription::maintenances) expose which path
//! each poll took.
//!
//! Deliberately pull-driven: nothing here retains operator state or
//! integrated inputs. Demand transformation over the existing
//! top-down engine is the architecture; the diff is the signal, the
//! cover is the gate, and per-entity re-derivation is the
//! maintenance step. Dynamically maintained demand (cones that grow
//! with data) builds on this same surface.
//!
