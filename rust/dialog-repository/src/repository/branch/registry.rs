//! The branch registry: where a branch's existence is recorded.
//!
//! A branch exists as a set of memory cells. The fact that it exists is
//! what makes it findable, and that fact lives in a branch of its own,
//! named [`REGISTRY`](crate::REGISTRY).
//!
//! # Why this lives here
//!
//! A branch records itself with `dialog.branch/*` facts, and the
//! `dialog.` namespace is reserved for machinery-written facts --
//! revision records, delegation records -- so that application writes
//! cannot forge them. Recording a branch is the same kind of write, so
//! it goes through the same [`machinery`](super::Commit::machinery)
//! scope, beside the delegation records that already use it.
