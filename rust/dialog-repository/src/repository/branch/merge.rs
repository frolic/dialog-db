//! Merging a commit that lost the race for its branch's head.
//!
//! A commit builds on the head it read (the base) and publishes against
//! it. When another writer advanced the head first, the commit's revision
//! is already durable, just not the head. Merging keeps that revision
//! exactly as minted, editions and records included, and publishes a
//! merge of it with the head that won: the same merge a pull performs
//! between peers, with the roles fixed by the race. The base is known
//! exactly, the losing side is one commit, and both sides are local, so
//! nothing is fetched and no merge direction is chosen.
//!
//! Only a revision the winning head has not seen can be kept. A writer
//! racing itself on one branch mints the same edition twice, and the
//! loser's version is already taken; that race is refused instead.
