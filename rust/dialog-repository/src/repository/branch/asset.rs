//! Assets: content a line stores in its blob store and records as a fact.
//!
//! An [`Asset`] names content by its hash and size, and its entity is
//! `asset:<hash>`. Asserting an asset on a transaction stores it: the commit
//! writes the bytes through the blob store and records
//! `asset:<hash> dialog.asset/size <size>` in the same revision as the
//! transaction's other facts, so those facts may point at the asset's entity.
//! Retracting the asset retracts that fact, dropping the line's reference to
//! the bytes. Push ships an asset's bytes with the revision that records it,
//! and a replica hydrates them through the entity like any blob.
//!
//! Content held in memory is asserted directly. Content too large to hold is
//! imported first: [`Branch::asset`] takes a stream of chunks, and its
//! [`import`](AssetStream::import) streams them into the blob store and
//! returns the asset naming them, which is then asserted:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use dialog_artifacts::Asset;
//! # use dialog_effects::blob::BlobError;
//! # use dialog_repository::Branch;
//! # async fn example<Env>(
//! #     branch: &Branch,
//! #     env: &Env,
//! #     photo: Vec<u8>,
//! #     chunks: futures_util::stream::Iter<std::vec::IntoIter<Result<Vec<u8>, BlobError>>>,
//! # ) -> anyhow::Result<()>
//! # where
//! #     Env: dialog_capability::Provider<dialog_effects::blob::Write>
//! #         + dialog_common::ConditionalSync
//! #         + 'static,
//! # {
//! let photo = Asset::from(photo);
//! let video = branch.asset(chunks).import().perform(env).await?;
//! let transaction = branch.transaction().assert(photo).assert(video);
//! # let _ = transaction;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Recording and dropping an asset are both a transaction's job:
//! `tx.assert(asset)` records it and `tx.retract(asset)` drops it.
//!
//! # On a sealed line
//!
//! A sealed line seals its assets too, unless told not to. The commit
//! seals the bytes an asset carries, and an import seals as it streams;
//! either way only the sealed copy is written, under the hash of its own
//! bytes, and the line records where it lives in place of the asset's
//! size (`asset:<hash> dialog.asset/sealed <copy>`), inside its sealed
//! tree.
//! Reads open the sealed copy, whole or in ranges; push, export and
//! download move it and never the plaintext.
//!
//! To keep a given asset in the clear on a sealed line, say so:
//! [`Asset::plaintext`] for one asserted on a transaction, and
//! [`AssetStream::plaintext`] for an import. A stored asset that names
//! plaintext bytes without saying so is refused there
//! ([`CommitError::PlaintextAsset`]).
