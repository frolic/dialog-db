//! Staged transaction chains: commit without publishing, publish once.
//!
//! A commit on a branch transaction does NOT move the branch head.
//! It mints the revision — on the branch's own origin, at the successor
//! edition, byte-identical to what a published commit would mint — and
//! hands back a [`TransactionBatch`] holding the staged chain. Further
//! transactions extend the chain; [`TransactionBatch::publish`] moves
//! the branch head to the chain tip with one CAS, making every staged
//! commit visible atomically, at exactly the versions minted.
//!
//! This is what lets a writer record a fact naming its own commit
//! without prediction or a second published commit: commit once, read
//! the minted [`Version`] off the batch, assert it in the next commit
//! on the same chain, publish. Either both commits become visible or
//! neither does.
//!
//! A batch that loses the publish CAS (the head moved: a pull, another
//! writer) is stale wholesale — its editions are taken. Recovery is to
//! re-run the transaction against the fresh head, minting fresh
//! versions; nothing staged is ever rewritten.
