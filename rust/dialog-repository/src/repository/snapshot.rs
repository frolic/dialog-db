//! Views of a repository at one revision: readable, transactable, and
//! the content transfer built on them.
//!
//! A [`Snapshot`] holds its own head, so what it names moves only when
//! it commits -- unlike a [`Branch`](crate::Branch), whose head lives in
//! a memory cell every handle to the branch shares. It reads exactly
//! like a branch ([`claims`](Snapshot::claims), [`select`](Snapshot::select),
//! [`query`](Snapshot::query), [`history`](Snapshot::history), blob
//! reads) and it transacts exactly like one
//! ([`transaction`](Snapshot::transaction), [`commit`](Snapshot::commit)
//! return the branch's own command types). Clone to keep the view you
//! have before advancing.
//!
//! Nothing here publishes or moves a branch head. A snapshot's commits
//! are minted on a line of their own (see [`Snapshot`]); making one
//! visible under a name stays a separate act, as does content transfer:
//! [`Snapshot::export`] reads content out, [`Repository::import`] writes
//! content in.
//!
//! # Two channels, not one
//!
//! A snapshot's content divides into two kinds that cannot share a stream,
//! because they land in different providers and verify at different times:
//!
//! - **Blocks** (tree nodes and spilled values) are whole values written
//!   through `archive::Put`. Each carries the digest it must hash to,
//!   checked before it is stored.
//! - **Blobs** are streamed through `blob::Import`, opened with a declared
//!   digest and size and verified at `finish` -- a blob arrives in pieces,
//!   so it cannot be checked on arrival the way a block can.
//!
//! Both channels declare a digest and both are verified against it. What
//! differs is only *when* the check can happen.
//!
//! # Export is best-effort at the leaves; `download` is the guarantee
//!
//! [`SnapshotExport`] reads what the local store holds and reports referenced
//! content it could not find, rather than failing -- a snapshot of a
//! partially fetched branch is a legitimate thing to want.
//!
//! That tolerance stops at the tree itself. A missing spilled value or
//! blob is a leaf: it is skipped, recorded, and the rest of the export is
//! still coherent. A missing *node* is not, because the walk cannot pass
//! it and everything beneath it becomes unreachable -- there is no way to
//! enumerate what was lost, so a gap in the tree aborts.
//!
//! [`SnapshotExport::download`] resolves both by hydrating read-misses from an
//! upstream as the walk proceeds, which is what makes the result complete.
