//! Speculative replication for evaluations: the env's ambient
//! [`PreloadQueue`] of ranges worth fetching ahead of demand, driven by
//! whatever evaluation is currently polling.
//!
//! Design: `notes/fetch-scheduler.md` (beads dialog-db-75/82). The
//! load-bearing constraints, restated:
//!
//! - **The env is never owned.** The queue holds descriptions only —
//!   selectors and ranks, no futures, no env. Work materializes into
//!   fetch futures exclusively inside a [`Driven`] stream, borrowing the
//!   same env the wrapped evaluation already borrows, and lives exactly
//!   as long as that stream.
//! - **Demand is never behind speculation.** Demand reads keep their
//!   existing path untouched; when a preload's fetch for the same object
//!   is in flight, the env's `Hydrate` flight joins them. A queued-but-
//!   unstarted item is simply ignored by demand, and hydration makes it a
//!   local no-op when the driver later reaches it.
//! - **The driver is the evaluation.** Progress happens whenever a
//!   consumer polls a driven stream — on any executor, wasm included,
//!   with nothing detached. A queue nobody drives holds no resources.
//!   The queue being ambient (an operator field, reached by the
//!   [`Speculation`](dialog_artifacts::Speculation) command) is what
//!   lets one evaluation's polling execute another's hints: queries,
//!   subscriptions, and transaction queries all enqueue and all drive.
