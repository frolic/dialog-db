//! Platform crypto for sealing and revealing.
//!
//! Native runs AES-256-GCM and HKDF-SHA256 in Rust; the browser routes both
//! through `WebCrypto` so they use the platform's accelerated, constant-time
//! implementations rather than a software AES compiled to wasm. Both produce
//! the same bytes -- AES-GCM and HKDF are fully specified -- so a secret sealed
//! on one platform opens on the other.
