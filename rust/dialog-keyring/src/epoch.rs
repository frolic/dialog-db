//! Epochs: named key generations, and the log that records them.
//!
//! An epoch is *named*, not counted. Its identifier is the hash of its own
//! record, so two writers who rotate concurrently mint two distinct epochs
//! without needing to agree on an order — the same way two concurrent updates
//! in BeeKEM leave a conflict node holding both versions rather than one
//! winning.
//!
//! This is what makes rotation work without coordination, and it is not
//! optional: a key derived deterministically from public state would be known
//! to whoever knew the previous key, which is exactly the party rotation
//! exists to lock out. Fresh entropy is required, and fresh entropy cannot be
//! agreed on without communication.
