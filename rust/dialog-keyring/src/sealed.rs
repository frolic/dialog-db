//! The sealed blob: what a content-addressed store actually holds.
//!
//! # Wire format
//!
//! ```text
//! version(1) || epoch(32) || nonce(12) || ciphertext || tag(16)
//! ```
//!
//! The header is plaintext because it has to be: a reader needs to know which
//! epoch to resolve *before* it can decrypt anything. It is authenticated —
//! version and epoch are the AEAD's additional data — so it can be read
//! without being trusted.
//!
//! # Why the nonce is derived from the plaintext
//!
//! The Dialog search tree is content-addressed, and the whole point of that is that two
//! replicas which independently compute the same node compute the same hash,
//! so a diff can prune matching subtrees without reading them. A random nonce
//! would destroy that: identical nodes would seal to different bytes, hash
//! differently, and every diff would see changes that are not there.
//!
//! So the nonce is `blake3::keyed_hash(key, domain || epoch || plaintext)`,
//! truncated to 12 bytes. Same plaintext under the same epoch seals to
//! identical bytes; different plaintexts get different nonces, which is what
//! AES-GCM requires. The hash is *keyed*, so someone without the key cannot
//! confirm a guess at the plaintext by recomputing the nonce.
//!
//! Two costs come with that, and both are deliberate:
//!
//! - Identical plaintext under one epoch is visibly identical to a store that
//!   holds both. Within a group whose members can decrypt both anyway, this is
//!   narrow — but it is real, and it is the price of convergence.
//! - A 96-bit derived nonce collides at the birthday bound. A collision
//!   between *different* plaintexts under one key needs on the order of 2^48
//!   sealed blobs in a single epoch.
