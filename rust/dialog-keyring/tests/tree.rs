//! Sealing composed with the shapes the search tree actually produces.
//!
//! The unit tests pin the sealing layer's properties against synthetic bytes.
//! These pin the two claims that only hold if it composes with a real Dialog
//! search tree: that sealing does not disturb how the tree chunks itself, and that
//! two replicas which independently build the same tree still agree on every
//! address.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* done here is threading the sealed address back
//! into each `Link`, so that a parent points at its children's ciphertext
//! rather than their plaintext. These tests establish that the layer
//! underneath behaves, which is what has to be true first.
