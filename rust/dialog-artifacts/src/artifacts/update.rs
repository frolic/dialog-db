///   .the(attr)     → AEV → residual (entity,    value_tail)
///   .is(value)     → VAE → residual (attribute, entity)

/// - lock `value`   → `value_tail` drops out, `attribute` is next ✓ (VAE)
/// - lock `attribute` → `attribute` itself drops out, `entity` is

/// source's output by `SortKey` yields the same order the tree's
/// scan would for that selector — which is what lets the query
/// layer's k-way merge interleave a branch scan and a `Changes`
/// overlay (or two branches) into the order a single physical tree
/// containing all of them would produce. It also holds for
/// multi-constraint selectors:
/// pinning two dimensions just removes both from the comparison.

/// bare type discriminant plus reference: the tree orders same-`(the, of)`
/// facts by exactly those tail bytes. A spilled value's slot holds the encoded
