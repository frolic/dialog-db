//! Write-buffered artifact trees.
//!
//! The commit path applies instructions through one of two write targets:
//!
//! - a [`TransientTree`] edit batch, which reshapes the tree as it writes, so
//!   every batch rebuilds and re-hashes the leaves it touches; or
//! - a [`HitchhikerTree`], which appends the writes to bounded per-node buffers
//!   and lets the reshape happen later, amortized across many batches.
//!
//! Both are driven by exactly the same instruction semantics, so they are
//! abstracted here as [`ArtifactWriter`] and the instruction loop
//! ([`ArtifactTreeExt::apply_versioned`](crate::ArtifactTreeExt::apply_versioned))
//! is written once against it.
//!
//! # Buffered roots are publishable
//!
//! A node's hash covers its `novelty` as well as its links, so a buffered root
//! identifies the content beneath it exactly: reads merge the buffers over the
//! stored entries, the differential is novelty-aware, and a buffered node's
//! block carries its own ops for push. Publishing one is sound.
//!
//! What a buffered root is *not* is **canonical**: the same fact set hashes
//! differently depending on where its ops currently sit, so two replicas that
//! buffered and flushed at different points hold different roots for identical
//! content. Nothing breaks, but root equality stops implying content equality,
//! so a fast-forward check no longer recognizes such replicas as equal and they
//! do merge work that finds nothing.
//!
//! Canonicality is therefore a property to reach for deliberately, via
//! [`BufferedArtifactTree::canonicalize`] (surfaced on the commit path as
//! `commit(..).canonicalize()` and on stores as
//! [`Artifacts::canonicalize`](crate::Artifacts::canonicalize)), rather than a
//! precondition for publishing. The policy across the stack: ordinary commits
//! seal buffered; sync and publish do NOT canonicalize (buffered novelty sits
//! near the root, so replicas differ in a few top blocks rather than many
//! leaf paths, and the diff exchanges fewer blocks); bulk-load paths
//! canonicalize once, explicitly, at the end of the import.
