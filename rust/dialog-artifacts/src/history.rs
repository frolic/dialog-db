//! Version control primitives grounded in the revision DAG.
//!
//! This module implements the causal encoding described in
//! `notes/version-control.md`. Instead of deriving causal position from a
//! logical counter that is local to a repository's synchronization history
//! (see `notes/divergence-clock.md`), causal position is derived from the
//! structure of the revision DAG itself:
//!
//! - [`Edition`] is the count of revisions in the causal chain leading to a
//!   revision — a Lamport timestamp, comparable across repository boundaries.
//! - [`Origin`] is a repository-scoped identity for an issuer, derived as
//!   `Blake3(issuer + subject)`.
//! - [`Version`] pairs the two into a compact revision identifier that sorts
//!   naturally by causal depth.
//! - [`Cause`] is a set of [`Version`]s identifying the prior claims (or
//!   parent revisions) superseded by a claim (or revision).
//! - [`Revision`] is a signed, content-addressed record of a commit.
//! - [`causality`] implements the tiered conflict detection over a
//!   [`History`] index, determining whether two claims on the same
//!   `(entity, attribute)` are causally ordered or concurrent.

// The identity and clock half of version control lives in dialog-capability
// (Revision's fields are built from it, and dialog-artifacts depends on that
// crate). Re-exported here so this module remains the single import site.

// derivation the live paths must never use, since two branches advanced
// by one issuer would mint colliding versions — and signs a different
// payload. It survives only as the fixture type of this module's unit
// tests (`MemoryHistory` stores it); nothing outside the tests may
