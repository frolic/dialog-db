//! The spilled-value differential: surfacing spilled value blocks for upload.
//!
//! A value larger than the inline threshold does not live in the key or the
//! payload; its raw bytes are a content-addressed block in the archive block
//! store, keyed by the value's 32-byte reference (written on commit by
//! [`ArtifactTreeExt::apply`](crate::tree::ArtifactTreeExt::apply)). Those
//! blocks are addressed independently of the tree nodes, so the tree-node
//! differential push already runs does not surface them. [`spilled_refs`]
//! mirrors [`blob_changes`](crate::blob_changes): it walks the tree
//! differential and names exactly the spilled value blocks newly referenced
//! between two tree versions, so push can ship them alongside the novel nodes.
