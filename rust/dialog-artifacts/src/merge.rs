//! Observed-remove screening for merge differentials.
//!
//! A pull merges by integrating the *upstream's* changes since the sync
//! base onto the *local* tree. Raw tree integration alone cannot express
//! deletion semantics — the active indexes carry no tombstones — so the
//! incoming differential is screened before integration (see
//! `notes/version-control.md`):
//!
//! - **R1** — an incoming live claim the receiver has *observed* (its
//!   producing revision is in the local head's ancestry) is never
//!   re-applied: if the local cache still holds it, there is nothing to
//!   do; if it no longer does, some record in the local log covered it,
//!   and applying it would resurrect a deletion. Unobserved claims are
//!   news and pass through (a same-key contest between two unobserved
//!   byte-variants of the same fact falls to the tree's deterministic
//!   hash race — both assert the same value).
//! - **R2** — incoming removes pass through untouched; the tree's
//!   byte-guarded remove (only delete what matches exactly) is already
//!   the correct observed-remove rule.
//! - **R3** — incoming history records that *cover* claims (a
//!   retraction's `cause`, a replace's `supersedes`) are applied to the
//!   local live set: for each covered version still live locally, a
//!   guarded remove is emitted. This is how a deletion reaches a replica
//!   whose sync base never covered the fact (e.g. an empty-base pull),
//!   with no tombstone anywhere.
//!
//! # Two passes, in this order
//!
//! Coverage must land before data: an incoming re-assert and the
//! retraction it supersedes can arrive in one delta, and if the data
//! change were integrated first it would contest a slot that R3 is
//! about to clear — letting an arbitrary race decide what causality
//! already decided. The merge therefore integrates the **history
//! region first** ([`screen_history`]: record appends + R3 removes
//! against the pre-merge snapshot), then the **data regions**
//! ([`screen_data`]: R1). Region scoping rides the key tags: history
//! keys sort under [`HISTORY_KEY_TAG`], data under the
//! entity/attribute/value (and blob) tags.
//!
//! Every rule is O(1) per changed key, and the screen reads only the
//! receiver's own snapshot and context — nothing about the sender's
//! state beyond the differential itself.
