/// The [`PersistentTree`] represents an immutable, persistent data structure
/// where each modification creates a new version while sharing unchanged nodes
/// through structural sharing. The tree stores key-value pairs in sorted order
/// and provides efficient lookups and range queries. It is read-only;

/// [`persist`](TransientTree::persist).
///
/// Nodes are stored in content-addressed storage using [`Blake3Hash`] as
/// identifiers, enabling deduplication and efficient versioning. The tree
/// maintains a [`Delta`] of pending changes that can be flushed to storage in

/// ## Clone Semantics
///
/// Cloning a [`PersistentTree`] does **not** fork the internal state. Instead,
/// it shares the cache and delta via reference counting. An edit batch
/// implicitly forks the tree by producing a new instance with a branched
/// [`Delta`] (independent copy) and an updated root hash, while continuing to
/// share the [`Cache`]. This enables efficient versioning where multiple tree
/// versions share the same cache for read operations, but maintain independent
/// mutation state.
