//! Hitchhiker (fractal / Bε) tree write buffering over the search tree.
//!
//! A [`HitchhikerTree`] holds the same content-addressed spine a
//! [`PersistentTree`] does, but every index node may carry a bounded buffer of
//! pending ops (its `novelty`). A write appends an op to the root's buffer;
//! when a buffer overflows it cascades one level down toward the leaves. The
//! expensive canonical rebuild is amortized across many writes instead of paid
//! eagerly on every one.
//!
//! The algorithm mirrors the reference hitchhiker tree's `enqueue`, with the
//! buffer grouped per child link (see [`crate::Novelty`]):
//!
//! - A **leaf** does not buffer. Ops that reach a leaf are deferred and applied
//!   through the canonical [`TransientTree`] insert/delete path, which reshapes
//!   exactly as a sequential edit would.
//! - An **index** routes each arriving op to the child link covering it (one
//!   binary search over the separators, the same rule stored routing uses) and
//!   merges it into that link's buffer, newest op for a key last.
//! - An **index that overflows** cascades one level down: each child receives
//!   its own link's buffer verbatim (the grouping already happened at enqueue,
//!   so there is no partition step) and the node's buffers are left empty.
//!
//! [`canonicalize`](HitchhikerTree::canonicalize) forces a full flush: every
//! buffer is pushed all the way to the leaves, leaving all `novelty` empty. The
//! result is the deterministic, history-independent canonical tree, byte for
//! byte identical to a sequential build of the same fact set.
