//! The format manifest carried by every tree node.
//!
//! The tree's format constants — the branching parameter, the separator-length
//! bound, and the value inline-vs-spill threshold — determine node bytes, and
//! node bytes are the content address, so those constants are secretly part of
//! the format. Keeping them only in code means two peers on different builds
//! silently produce non-convergent trees for the same data. The manifest makes
//! them **data**: it is inlined into every node so any node hash stays a
//! complete, self-describing tree root (the differ, structural sharing, and
//! `from_hash` all rely on a bare node hash being a usable root).
//!
//! The manifest is a handful of bytes, identical across every node in a tree,
//! so front coding and structural sharing store it once in practice.
//!
//! The `version` pins interpretation: a peer reading a node with a version it
//! knows uses the exact matching constants. Changing a constant means bumping
//! the version, which changes every node hash — a visible, intentional fork
//! rather than a silent one.
//!
//! Enforcement today is at the EDIT boundary: loading a root whose header
//! differs from the edit's manifest (including an unknown version) fails
//! loudly (see `TransientTree::load`), because an edit under the wrong
//! parameters would re-coin the touched spine and silently break shape
//! convergence. Pure reads do not check the header — the node encoding is
//! self-delimiting and version 1 is the only shipped format. Adopting the
//! loaded root's manifest for edits (instead of rejecting) is the tracked
//! follow-up on `TransientTree::manifest`.
