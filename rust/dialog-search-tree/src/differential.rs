//! Tree differentiation and integration.
//!
//! This module computes the difference between two tree versions and applies
//! change streams onto a tree. Both operations are built around the same
//! frugality contract: **only blocks on differing paths are ever read**.
//! Subtrees whose hashes match between the two versions are pruned by
//! comparing the hashes carried in their parents' links, without loading the
//! subtrees themselves, so the number of storage reads is proportional to the
//! size of the difference rather than the size of the trees. A caller that
//! consumes the whole difference over a high-latency backend can opt into
//! [`Prefetch::Eager`], which relaxes the contract at the margin (a bounded
//! number of prunable or by-hash-reportable blocks may be read) in exchange
//! for fetching each frontier level concurrently instead of node by node.
//!
//! [`TreeDifference::compute`] produces a sparse representation of both trees
//! holding only the differing regions. From it, two products are available:
//!
//! - [`TreeDifference::changes`]: entry-level [`Change`]s that transform the
//!   source tree into the target tree (used for merge/replication).
//! - [`TreeDifference::novel_nodes`]: the target-tree nodes absent from the
//!   source tree (used to upload exactly the missing blocks to a remote).

///   replica stores every block it mints, so a block it does not hold is
///   not its novelty — it marks the boundary of local knowledge. The walk
///   treats the node as settled: it contributes only the ops routed to it
///   (those live in an ancestor's held bytes), is never descended, and is
///   never reported novel. Sound for novelty computation on the SOURCE
