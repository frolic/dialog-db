//! Tree specification macro and test utilities.
//!
//! This module provides tools to create search trees with deterministic
//! structure for testing the differential algorithm. The [`crate::tree_spec!`]
//! macro describes the exact shape a tree should take; ranks are read
//! straight out of the spec keys by [`DistributionSimulator`] instead of
//! being derived from key hashes, so the resulting tree matches the spec
//! exactly.
//!
//! It also provides utilities for iterating over all nodes in a tree, which
//! is useful for testing, debugging, and advanced introspection.
//!
//! # Tree Specification Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {
//! use dialog_search_tree::helpers::{TestStorage, TreeSpec, test_storage};
//! use dialog_search_tree::tree_spec;
//!
//! let storage: TestStorage = test_storage();
//!
//! let spec = tree_spec![
//!     [                        ..l]  // Height 1 (index nodes)
//!     [..a, c..e, f..f, g..g, h..l]  // Height 0 (segment nodes/leaves)
//! ];
//!
//! let tree_spec: TreeSpec = spec.build(storage).await?;
//! let tree = tree_spec.tree();
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```

/// # Tree Specification Macro
///
/// The `tree_spec!` macro allows you to visually define the exact structure of
/// a search tree for testing purposes. Instead of relying on unpredictable rank
/// distributions, you specify exactly which keys should be boundaries at which
/// heights.
///
/// ## Syntax
///
/// ```text
/// let spec = tree_spec![
///     [                        ..l]  // Height 1 (index nodes)
///     [..a, c..e, f..f, g..g, h..l]  // Height 0 (segment nodes/leaves)
/// ];
///
/// let tree = spec.build(storage).await?;
/// ```
///
/// ### Range Syntax Rules
///
/// 1. **Brackets `[...]`**: Each line represents one height level
///    - Top line = highest height (root/index nodes)
///    - Bottom line = height 0 (segment nodes/leaves)
///
/// 2. **Commas `,`**: Separate sibling segments within a level
///    - `[..a, c..e, ..l]` = three segments with upper bounds a, e, l
///
/// 3. **Range operators**: Define segment boundaries using Rust's range syntax
///    - `..x` = segment ending at 'x' (first key inferred from previous or
///      starts at 'a')
///    - `a..b` = segment explicitly from 'a' to 'b' (inclusive)
///    - Multi-char keys supported: `..aa`, `ab..az` (Excel-style naming: a-z, aa-az, etc.)
///
/// 4. **Parentheses**: Mark nodes expected to be pruned (not read) during a
///    differential: `(..x)` or `(a..b)`
///
/// ## Key Inference
///
/// The macro infers which keys exist in the tree based on specified ranges:
///
/// ```text
/// [..a, c..e, ..f, ..g, ..l]
/// ```
///
/// This creates:
/// - Range `..a`: contains key 'a' only
/// - Range `c..e`: contains keys c, d, e (first key explicit)
/// - Range `..f`: contains key 'f' only (next after 'e')
/// - Range `..g`: contains key 'g' only (next after 'f')
/// - Range `..l`: contains keys h, i, j, k, l (starts after 'g')
/// - Note: 'b' is NOT in the tree (gap between 'a' and 'c')
///
/// ## Structure Validation
///
/// The macro validates that:
/// 1. Every boundary in a parent level has a corresponding child
/// 2. Boundaries are in strictly ascending order
/// 3. Child boundaries don't exceed parent boundaries
