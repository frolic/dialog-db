//! In-place batched tree edits.
//!
//! [`TransientTree`] opens a [`PersistentTree`]'s spine and applies a sequence
//! of inserts and deletes by mutating that live structure with a copy-on-write
//! descent. Each operation descends from the root to the target leaf, lifting
//! only the nodes on the path from [`Node::Persistent`] references to editable
//! [`Node::Transient`] form, applies the change to the leaf, then re-shapes the
//! touched path so the tree is canonical again. Untouched siblings stay shared
//! by reference. The shape rules are history-independent, so a batch of edits
//! and the equivalent sequence of single edits each persisted in turn converge
//! on the same root, byte for byte, after every operation.
//!
//! [`persist`](TransientTree::persist) is a pure bottom-up serializer: it makes
//! no shape decisions, because the shape was already established at edit time.
